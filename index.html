	<div id="aboutme"><h3>About me</h3>
My name is Justin. I am 38 years old, from Brisbane, born and bred from Irish and English descent. 
Growing up I guess you would have defined me as an athlete. At the age of 16 I was a nationally ranked Tennis player, state shot put champion and finalist in 100m, 200m sprints, 110m hurdles, long jump, discus and javelin. That year I was presented with one of the first in Australia, Pierre de Coubertin awards, for my accomplishments by the Olympic committee. The next year a growth in my leg was diagnosed as lymphoma, which it was surgically removed and was treated with a couple of rounds of chemotherapy but blocked my path to becoming a professional athlete.<br>
When I finished high school, I started working for the family business developing and manufacturing natural and organic fertilizers for use in agriculture and horticulture. Although I have no formal education, I have spent my entire career studying agronomy, biology, chemistry and applying them to my field. 
I now manage the family business which is on track with becoming self-sustainable so I can concentrate my focus on this new career path.
