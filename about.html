  <h3>My ideal job</h3>
<div>
My ideal job would be working for an innovative automotive manufacturer such as Tesla working in research and development. Since I was a teenager and bought my first car, I have been modifying both mechanically and electronically with the best gadgets I can find or to be more precise, what I could afford. Working for a company that develops new technology, gadgets and works to improve the entire field in performance, safety and reliability. I think the need for automation of driving to whatever degree is becoming more noticeable in Australia now with the shear volume of cars on the road and the increasing danger to motorists. The idea that most accidents can be avoided by eliminating human error or human emotion/arrogance is something that will save many lives, reduce driver stress and improve the majorities way of life. With enough experience and contacts in the industry I would like to start my own company in automotive part design and manufacturing and expand from there, helping to fill the void in the Australian automotive manufacturing market.&nbsp; </div>

		  <p>~The results of the personality test were expected. I've always been a person who takes charge, formulates plans and assings tasks which has already been displayed in my group. I organised a conference call for everyone to introduce themselves and talk a little about their goals and aspirations for their future careers. Since then everyone has been communicating and helping eachother actively on the Discord app.&nbsp;</p>
		  <p><strong>Average EQ You have slightly above average EQ</strong> – with room to grow! You are likely sensitive to the emotional climate of the people around you when you and they – peers, friends, family and key clients – are under pressure. You are aware of the effect your behavior has on others. While you may be adept at tuning into others and their needs – you must remember your own. Don’t be afraid to honestly communicate these difficult needs and feelings. This is one of the most important aspects of Emotional Intelligence: being able to skillfully air your grievances.</p>
		  <p>~The results from this test are a little odd though I have difficulty expressing my emotions I don't have any difficulty in discussing my grievences in a professional manner.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
